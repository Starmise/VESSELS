# VESSELS
VESSELS is an experimental narrative prototype built in Unreal Engine 5. You play as an AI entity, unknowingly seeking to understand human emotions. Each level represents a distinct emotion through atmospheric visuals, puzzles, and sound design, drawing heavy inspiration from the aesthetic and music of the cinematographic band Starset.
